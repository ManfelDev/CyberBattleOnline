## Description

Cyber Battle is a top-down shooter game where the objective for players is to achieve the highest score possible within the time limit. It is a multiplayer game that uses Unity Networking (NGO) to synchronize player actions. Players compete against each other, collecting score-giving points scattered across the map, while the network ensures all interactions are recorded and reflected in real-time for all participants. When a player is eliminated, their points are reset.
